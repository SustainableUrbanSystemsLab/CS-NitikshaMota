## Research Title
**Equitable Street Tree Canopy Design for Heat Mitigation in Low-Income Neighborhoods:  
A Microclimate Study of Joseph E. Boone Blvd, Atlanta**

---

## Abstract
This independent study investigates how the spatial configuration of street-tree canopy—
including spacing, side placement, and alternating patterns—can reduce pedestrian and transit
heat exposure in low-income neighborhoods. Using Joseph E. Boone Boulevard in Atlanta as a
case study, the research combines GIS-based heat vulnerability mapping with Outdoor+ microclimate
simulations to evaluate thermal performance under different tree-planting scenarios. The study
aims to inform equitable, corridor-scale urban forestry strategies that mitigate heat without
accelerating displacement pressures.

## Methods
- GIS analysis of heat vulnerability, canopy cover, and socio-economic indicators
- Corridor-scale modeling of Joseph E. Boone Blvd
- Outdoor+ (BlueCFD) simulations for morning and afternoon summer conditions
- Comparative testing of:
  - Evenly spaced trees on both sides
  - Alternating tree configurations
  - Clustered vs continuous canopy strategies

---

## Key Findings
- Alternating tree configurations can maintain thermal comfort while reducing planting density
- Dual-sided canopy placement offers more consistent pedestrian shading
- Strategic spacing improves Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) reduction at bus stops and sidewalks
- Equity-focused canopy design must be paired with anti-displacement policy awareness
